# Things to do until the project is ready to go live:
# OK 1. CSS customization
# Almost OK 2. Let the user customize the pomodoro settings. Also make the 
# pomodoro sessions 'pomme' work
# OK 3. Create a Python virtual environment, commit the changes and send upload to Github
# 4. Set the system live on PythonAnywhere
# 5. Sount alert for when the time is up
# 6. Skip function
# Bonus: Somehow collect user's data, maybe with cookies? 
# ... I wish I could get the user's browser activity
